# minesweeper

A game I made in Python using PyGame back in 2019. 4 years later, I wanted to complete and improve upon it to see how much I've improved as a coder.

List of TODOs:  
-Make it so the first click is guaranteed to not be an instant loss  
-Fix bugs (there are a lot)  
-Make code more readable and more efficient

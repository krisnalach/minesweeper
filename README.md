# minesweeper

A game I made in Python using PyGame back in 2019. 4 years later, I wanted to complete and improve upon it to see how much I've improved as a coder.

Starting over from scratch in "game.py"
Focus is feeding this game into a reinforcement learning agent
to be able to play minesweeper

Game UI is a low priority at the moment
Mostly complete but a few UI bugs

Following the tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds
for implementing the DQN with PyTorch

# minesweeper

A continuation of my first ever Python project back in 2019.
Updated with a smarter implementation, comments, and cleaner code overall.

Game UI is a low priority. It is mostly complete, just has a few bugs.

Adapting the Deep Q-Network implementation from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds.
Currently my agent can learn simple games if presented statically. 
Training stability is a WIP.

### TODOs
Implement a target network
Upload graphs showing performance

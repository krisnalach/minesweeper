# minesweeper

A continuation of my first ever Python project back in 2019.
Updated with a smarter implementation, comments, and cleaner code overall.

Game UI is a low priority. It is mostly complete, just has a few bugs.

Adapting the Deep Q-Network implementation from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds.
Currently my agent can learn simple games if presented statically. 
Training stability is a WIP.

### Code Structure

play_game.py is for human players. Bugged since I've been focusing on the reinforcement learning (RL) agent.

agent.py is the RL agent

dqn.py is the deep q-network.

/archive holds my old implementation from 2019.

### TODOs
Implement a target network

Upload graphs showing performance
